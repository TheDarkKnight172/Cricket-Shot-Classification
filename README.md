# Cricket-Shot-Classification

1. First, download the dataset zip file and extract the folder. Download the FinalCode.ipynb file, which is the main code file. Optionally, you can download the 4 videos for final testing purposes.
2. In the code file, change the dataset path (in 2 places) to where it is installed in your computer.
3. Now install the necessary packages like tensorflow and anything else that pops up using "pip install _".
4. Keep running all the cells one by one. The model training process is very intensive and took 30 minutes on a RTX 4060.
5. Finally you can test the model at the end by using the seperate videos attached (or any other appropriate video of your choice) and replacing the path.
